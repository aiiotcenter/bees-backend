~~ Emergency Fix ~~
# Add back the WiFi default route immediately
sudo ip route add default via 10.101.127.254 dev wlan0 metric 50

# Remove the duplicate cellular routes
sudo ip route del default via 192.168.0.1 dev eth0

# Test immediately
ping -c 3 8.8.8.8


~~ If that works, make it permanent ~~
# Restart WiFi to get proper DHCP routes
sudo dhclient -r wlan0
sudo dhclient wlan0

# Check routes are correct
ip route show
